## Getting Started

Node v20.17.0
Npm v10.8.2

### Step 1

Clone the repo from the git url: git@github.com:GauravKesarwani/alma-app.git

### Step 2

create a .env file in the root of the project and add the below line. I have used file db using Prisma client.

DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

### Step 3

Run npm install

### Step 4

Run npm run dev

Note: Routes are set up at localhost:3000/user and localhost:3000/admin for assesment and admin pages respectively.

I have used JsonFroms with React Vanilla renderer for assesment form.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
